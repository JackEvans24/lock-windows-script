# Windows Lock Script

This is the single dumbest and most brilliant piece of code I have ever come up with

Running `Set.ps1` on a PC will set a scheduled task that will run at about the same time every day.

The task runs `Windows_Lock.ps1` which, as you can imagine, locks the current PC.

Perfect for messing with your peers if you can access their machines whilst they're away (for legal reasons I don't condone this).
