# Windows Lock Script

This is the single dumbest and most brilliant piece of code I have ever come up with

Running `Set.ps1` on a PC will set a scheduled task that will run at about the same time every day.

The task runs `Windows_Lock.ps1` which, as you can imagine, locks the current PC.

Perfect for messing with your peers if you can access their machines whilst they're away (for legal reasons I don't condone this).

Might also be good for limiting your PC usage - if you know you are usually struggling to get off your PC at 11pm, you could remove the random variation and set the date of the scheduled task manually to lock your PC at that time, and break the connection you have with whatever you're working on / playing.
